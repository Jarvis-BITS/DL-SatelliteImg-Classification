# DL-Satellite_Img-Classification
### This python program utilizes Pytorch to create a Deep Learning model centered around environment detection;detecting what type of environment is shown in satellite imagery i.e Playgrounds, residential areas etc.


#### Awesome DL satellite models to check out: [Robmarkcole Satellite DL](https://github.com/robmarkcole/satellite-image-deep-learning), [How to train image classifier](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-train-an-image-classifier-in-pytorch-and-use-it-to-perform-basic-inference-on-single-images-99465a1e9bf5)

##### The Ipynb file can be opened using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [Jupyter Notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython/ipython-in-depth/master?filepath=binder/Index.ipynb).

###### Note: When using a cloud based platform like Google Colab, switch on GPU based accelaration to reduce training times
